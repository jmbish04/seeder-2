## Machine-wide agent briefings (synced — do not edit here)

Pulled from `jmbish04/colby-ecosystem` by `.github/workflows/agents-sync.yml`, right-sized to this
repo's stack. Read them before your first load-bearing change; where they and the
notes below this block disagree, they win. Edit them in `jmbish04/colby-ecosystem`, never here.

The scripts in `scripts/` carrying a `colby-ecosystem: managed script` banner come from there too.
Use them rather than writing another: `scripts/gh.mjs` is the GitHub entry point
and wraps the `gh-tools` CLI, which already solves the auth this machine trips on.

Work is tracked in **colby-maestro** (`https://colby-maestro.hacolby.workers.dev/mcp`,
bearer `$(tokens show WORKER_API_KEY --value-only)`) — never in this repo and never
in colby-ecosystem, which only stores config. Refresh this block with
`.agents/ecosystem/pull-agents`.
